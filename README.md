## Notes

Building this application required patience and focus to complete each challenge. When I encountered an issue, it was often because I didn't have a good understanding of the task. However, by reading the source materials and filling in any gaps with additional reading materials, I was able to complete each challenge. I had the most trouble understanding how the console log output works. Only after reading and trying to find my answer online did I reach out to the WEB102 Slack channel. After Anuj helped explain what I was doing wrong, I felt confident enough to move along.
